Hi <%= name %>,

There hasn't been any activity on your <%= exercise.language %> <%= exercise.slug %> submission for over a week, and it is no longer showing up in the list of pending assignments.

If you want to take the submission out of hibernation, you can either respond to the nitpicks, or submit a new version.

Feel free to send me an email (katrina.owen@gmail.com) if you have any thoughts or suggestions or if you just want to tell me about your experience with the site.

Kind regards,
Katrina
