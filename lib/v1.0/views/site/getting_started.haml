        Write code using your usual tools. Make the tests pass. Keep the code as simple, readable, and expressive as you can.
      %p
        Submit the code to the website. Other people who have completed the same assignment provide a code review, ask questions, and discuss trade-offs with you.
      %p
        Based on their comments, revise your code and resubmit.

      %h2 Nitpicking
      %p
        Think deeply about how code can be improved.
      %p
        One particularly well-kept secret is that looking at someone's code with an eye towards finding ways of improving it can teach you more about writing readable code than receiving feedback on your own code.
      %p
        Doing this forces you to think about why you make the trade-offs that you do, what in the code you are reacting to, why you are reacting to it, and how you might improve it.
      %p
        There is rarely only one good solution to a problem. Asking questions and articulating your thoughts about these small problems can change your thinking about the issues you face in the code bases you work in on a day-to-day basis.
