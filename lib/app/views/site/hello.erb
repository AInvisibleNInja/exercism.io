    Most of you probably found your way here through the article on wired.com.
    </p>
    <p>
    Exercism began as a way to support students learning to code by giving them practice problems and real world feedback. The site was created by Katrina Owen while she was working as an Instructor at JumpStart Lab.

    <p>
    In a way, the entire site happened by accident as Exercism spread by word of mouth, whereby current users helped new users get started. If you happened to come to the site without the support of someone more experienced, it was very difficult to get started. We were working to make the onboarding process easier when we received a call from wired.com asking to feature us on their site. We were completely unprepared for (and happily surprised by) the enormous response to the article. In the past two days, our traffic increased by 500 times and our inboxes flooded with help requests.

    We apologize for the confusion and frustration you may have felt as you attempted to use Exercism to get started or improve your programming skills. We’re working on more detailed directions to help new users get started with the practice problems. We hope to have those available in the next few days. In the meanwhile, if you’re having trouble getting started, you’ll get the fastest answers <a href="https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/issues" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>. The best place to start is to look at current issues. If you don’t see your issue listed there, please <a href="https://github.com/exercism/exercism.io/issues/new" target="_blank">submit a new issue</a>.

    Thank you for your patience as we improve our onboarding processes. We’re so happy to have you here.
