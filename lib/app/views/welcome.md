### Thank you!

Thank you for trying out exercism.io, especially with all the chaos of _the early days_.

It came as a complete surprise to me that the project hit a nerve with people. I expected **dozens** of people to use the site. It's been 2 months since I showed the first couple of people, and since then 900 people have submitted over 8000 pieces of code.

It's exciting, and also a little scary. I hope that I can keep up, and that I don't disappoint you.

#### Experiment & Prototype

I still don't quite know what exercism.io will end up being. It helps that so many people are thinking out loud, sharing ideas, submitting bugs and feature requests and pull requests.

Not knowing where it is going means that everything could change. I will do my best to make that change as painless as possible, and will provide ample warning (and a data download) if things should change so drastically that you wouldn't be able to find early discussions.
